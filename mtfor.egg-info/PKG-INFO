Description: # What is mtfor
        
        "mtfor" or "multithreaded for" is a simple package that provides a for loop that automatically distributes the processing through a number of threads.
        
        # Installation
        
        You can use pip3 to install this utility by executing:
        ```
        pip3 install mtfor
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        The function signature is mtfor(list, function, number_of_threads). It returns your list already modified.
        
        This example prints the result of applying my_function to my_list using 4 threads.
        
        ```python
        from mtfor import mtfor
        
        NUM_THREADS = 4
        
        def my_function(x):
          return x * x
        
        my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
        modified_list = mtfor(my_list, my_function, NUM_THREADS)
        
        print(modified_list)
        ```
